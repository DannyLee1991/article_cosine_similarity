All woman born for loving

A little boy asked his mother:"Why are you crying?"

"Because I am a woman."She told him.

"I don't understand"he said.

His mum just hugged him and said:"And you never will."

Later the little boy asked his father:"Why does mother seem to cry for no reason?"

"All woman cry for no reason."Was all his dad could say.

The little boy grow up and became a man, still wondering why women cry.

Finally he put in a call to God, when God got on the phone, he asked,"God, why do women cry so easily?"

God said:"When I made the women, she had to be special. I made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world; yet, gentle enough to give comfort.

I gave her inner strength to endure childbirth, and the rejections many times comes from her children.

I gave her hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up, and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complains.

"I gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances, even her children has hurt her very badly.

"I gave her strength to carry her husband through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart."

"I gave her the wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife, but sometimes tests her strength and resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly."

"And finally, I gave her a tear to shed. That is her exclusively to use whenever it is needed."

"You see the beauty of a women is not the clothes she wears, the figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair."

"The beauty of a women must be seen in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where the love resides."
