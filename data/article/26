KEEP A WEEKLY ACCOMPLISHMENT JOURNAL

Lots of people keep a list of what they need to do in the coming days. Few people, however, keep a journal of what they’ve already accomplished. Why not?

A log of what you’ve done in the preceding week will serve as a motivation tool and a good resource for negotiating future promotions or filling a future CV. This type of accomplishment journal can also help with growing a business or starting a new healthy diet plan.

What have you accomplished this week? How do you keep yourself motivated? Let us know in the comments down below.
